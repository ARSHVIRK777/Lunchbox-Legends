    <h2>My Story: From Struggle to Strength ðŸ’ª</h2>
    <p>When I moved to Canada as an international student, I thought the hardest part would be school. But I quickly realized that managing health, food, and money was even harder.</p>
    <p>Eating out every day drained my wallet and left me feeling tired and unwell. I was eventually diagnosed with early signs of fatty liver. That was a wake-up call.</p>
    <p>With no family kitchen or fancy tools, I started learning quick meals using basic ingredients â€” simple, healthy, and affordable. Thatâ€™s how <strong>Lunchbox Legends</strong> was born.</p>
